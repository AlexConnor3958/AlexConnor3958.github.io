# My Portfolio Repo
This repo is about my portfolio for Games Development that I created for the Pro Dev module at Staffordshire University. This website is one part of my overall handin for the fist semester of Pro Dev. 

The portfolio contains some of the projects I've worked on throughout my time at Staffordshire University in multiple different code languages and also contains a link to both my LinkedIn and Github accounts.
